## 2025-08-09 - Fix Hydration Mismatch and Authentication UI

**Prompt Analysis:** User reported hydration mismatch warning: "app-index.js:33 Warning: Did not expect server HTML to contain a <div> in <div>." This is a common React issue when server-side rendered HTML differs from client-side HTML, typically caused by authentication state being available on client but not server.

**Result:** 
- Fixed hydration mismatch by adding `mounted` state to prevent auth-dependent rendering until after client hydration
- Created `/api/auth/config` route to fetch auth configuration client-side only
- Updated `AppLayout.tsx` to conditionally show navigation items based on authentication state
- Hidden main navigation items when user is not authenticated (except GitHub link)
- AuthButton already provided logout functionality when authenticated

**Files touched:**
- Modified: `/private/tmp/nextcloud/src/components/AppLayout.tsx` - Added mounted state, client-side auth config fetching, conditional navigation rendering
- Created: `/private/tmp/nextcloud/src/app/api/auth/config/route.ts` - API route to return auth configuration status
- Modified: `/private/tmp/nextcloud/src/components/auth/AuthButton.tsx` - Already had proper logout button when authenticated

**User feedback addressed:**
- "we need a logout button when logged in" - Already exists in AuthButton component
- "if not logged in, hide the button in the navbar, that makes no sense otherwise (except maybe Github)" - Implemented conditional rendering of navigation items
- Hydration mismatch warning resolved by preventing server/client HTML differences

**Testing:** Build completed successfully, hydration mismatch should be resolved.
