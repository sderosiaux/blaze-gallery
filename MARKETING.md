## ⚠️ Important Limitations

### RAW File Display
While Blaze Gallery fully supports RAW files for cataloging and download, **RAW files cannot be displayed directly in web browsers** due to technical limitations:

**What Works:**
- ✅ RAW file detection and cataloging
- ✅ EXIF metadata extraction and display
- ✅ File download for external editing
- ✅ Folder organization and navigation
- ✅ Search and filtering capabilities

**What Doesn't Work:**
- ❌ Direct RAW preview in browser (shows helpful message instead)
- ❌ Thumbnail generation for RAW files
- ❌ Slideshow mode with RAW files

**Supported RAW Formats:**
Canon (.CR2, .CR3), Nikon (.NEF), Sony (.ARW), Adobe (.DNG), Fujifilm (.RAF), Olympus (.ORF), Panasonic (.RW2), Pentax (.PEF), Samsung (.SRW), Sigma (.X3F)

**Recommendation:** Keep both RAW and JPEG versions in your B2 bucket. Blaze Gallery will display JPEGs while preserving access to your RAW originals for professional editing.
